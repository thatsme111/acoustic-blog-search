Online retail is recovering well from this far-from-normal shopping year.","Here’s what our data tells us:","Online retailers enjoyed: higher value purchases, less abandoned carts, higher engagement, and massive mobile shopping increases.","Compared to 2019, Average Order Value increased by 11%, while Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate went down by 3%.","Average Time on Page also went up by almost 300% compared to last year. In 2019, the metric was under 1 minute; in 2020, it was over 3 minutes. This increase demonstrates that retailers are doing more than ever to drive engagement and create a curated customer experience on their websites. Consumers are spending more time shopping online, including browsing and not just buying.","We also witnessed a continued rise in mobile activity. There was a 66% increase in iPhone mobile shopping activity and an 18% increase in Android mobile shopping activity. Even in a year when many shoppers were working from home and traveling infrequently or not at all—and thus, likely at home near a larger screen—they still turned to their phones to shop. Black Friday shoppers showed 32% more activity on phone vs. web compared to last year. Cyber Monday shoppers used mobile 28% more.","Our data showed that email is by far the top channel to drive traffic and convert sales in online stores. Paid Search, Natural Search, and Affiliate channels/third-party shopping websites were the top drivers of traffic outside of email.","f you’re a retailer curious to learn more about how we gathered this data, and what it might mean for your own business, please reach out. See our full infographic showcasing this data.","Source: Data compiled from activity on the Acoustic platform.
