This report analyzed our customers’ use of our email platform between January and May 2020 to see what impact the pandemic had on various email marketing behavior. You can view a recording of the webinar and download the accompanying content from our Acoustic webinar center. ","We were super excited to see the level of interest from marketers looking for guidance on how to adjust their email marketing strategies at a time when COVID-19 has changed everything. More than 400 marketers registered for the session! Further, our attendees stayed for the duration of the hour-long event—a rarity when it comes to webinars.","Now, amid back-to-school promotions and at a time when retailers especially are gearing up for a holiday season that will be difficult to predict, brands’ direct communications with their customers and target consumers are vitally important. We know email can be a highly effective channel, but our Benchmark Report told us that in the rush to communicate quickly at the height of COVID, some brands damaged their relationships with their contact lists. Why? Brands didn’t have their data in order. This not only impacts reputation management, but also compliance to important regulations like GDPR and CCPA."]}
