This limitation was not compatible with Wiley’s marketing needs and plans.","For example, let’s say a student was interested in a school and became a unique user in the system associated with said school. This student, though, was undoubtedly looking at multiple schools and likely using the same email address to do so. Two opportunities may have been in existence with the same user, but because the unique identifier was limited to a singular variable, Wiley was only able to market on behalf of one of those partner schools.","Wiley’s marketing team solved this by moving to a new marketing automation platform. During this process, leaders created a list of requirements that they knew they needed in a new system. After careful consideration of a wide variety of vendors’ current features and product roadmaps, the Wiley team decided on Acoustic."]}
